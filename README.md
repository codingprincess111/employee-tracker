# employee-tracker

This is a command-line application created using Node.js and MySQL to allow a business owner to view and manage departments, roles, managers and employees in their organization. 

## Installation

To install the application, clone the repository to your local machine and run the following command in the root directory: npm install


You will also need to set up your MySQL database by running the SQL scripts located in the db folder in the following order:

create a db folder with seeds.sql and scheme.sql files

## Usage

To use the application, run 'npm start' in your terminal. You will be presented with a menu of options which you can navigate using your arrow keys. 

You can choose to view departments, roles, or employees, add a new department, role, or employee, update an existing employee, role, and manager.


## Technologies 

Node.js, MySQL2, Inquirer.js, console.table

## Challenges

I tried using console.table for users to be able to view employee managers in table format, it did not work as shown in the last part of my walk-through video.
